# tpm-send

tpm2-send is a no-dependency utility for sending raw bytes to the TPM.

Want to access the TPM 2.0 from within WSL2? Just compile tpm2-send.exe and then call it from your WSL2 shell.


# Usage

tpm2-send takes an input stream (by default `stdin`) and an output stream (by default `stdout`).

```cmd
tpm2-send [-i <input file>] [-o <output file>]
```

## Examples

```cmd
tpm2-send -i in.bin -o out.bin
```

Or you can read from `stdin` and write to `stdout`:

```cmd
type in.bin | tpm2-send
```
